This is where my report will go temporarily, until I move it into a Word document. For now, I'll use a markdown file so that I can keep track of it with version control.

# Analysis

I will be developing an endless running and fighting game for Android. Essentially, the player will be jumping and moving between platforms (a 2D side view like in Super Mario Bros) and tackling various enemies. The game will use gesture controls (i.e. tapping and swiping the screen); I think this will create a tactile and satisfying experience for the player. The objective is to make it as far as possible before dying.

My initial idea was to have the player's movement fully automatic, controlled by an intelligent algorithm, however now I think that moving around is part of the fun and the strategy. I will still have to write that intelligent algorithm to control the movement of the enemies. I'm not yet sure exactly how the movement controls will work â€“ perhaps they could be semi-automatic, meaning the character carries on moving by itself with the player swiping with their left thumb to change direction; or I could use a more traditional virtual on-screen joystick. I'll decide by testing prototypes.

It will be targeted at teenagers to young adults, because that is the age group which plays the most live-action computer games.
